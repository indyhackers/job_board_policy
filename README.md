# Job Board Policy

The following are rough guidelines as to what is allowed or disallowed on the Indy Hackers Job Board.

1. Posts should explicitly mention the hiring company. It should be in the title. We'll add it if it isn't.
2. Posts should be for full-time employees making a salary.
3. Posts should be for an Indiana position for Indiana workers. If you're a company from NYC looking for a 100% remote dev, we wish you the best of luck, and we hope you hire a Hoosier. However, there are boards more suited to your needs.
